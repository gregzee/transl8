# Transl8

## Summary

Transl8 is a bot that will translate Ukrainian and Russian via Telegram. We noticed that a lot of the news and native groups in the region are discussing geopolitical events in real time. Sometimes this never gets translated to English, or it will be hours till an English news agency picks it up. 

So far this has helped those that are looking to stay involved, but more importantly, it has helped a few folks that are not speakers of either language and looking for a way out. 

While this was not the original intention, we were not aware during the thought of the bot. I would like for others who stumble upon this to send ideas how we could help those in-need in similar situations.

## Possible next steps
Looking at implementing OCR to translate images.


## The bot works by

1. Forwarding messages from group chats
2. Forwarding from private chats
3. using a /text command
- /text <russian/ukranian text>
