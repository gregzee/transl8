# Tines 

### Summary

Tines is a lowcode/no code automation platform. The purpose of this project was to be able to quickly get some form of translation bot out on telegram quick. We noticed that there was news on their that was in Russian or Ukranian coming in quicker than the 24/7 news cycle. We were able to build this out in Tines relatively faster than we would scripting in python.
