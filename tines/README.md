# Tines 

### Summary

Tines is a lowcode/no code automation platform. We used Tines for the bot because, it is easy to use and we could get it up and running far quicker than get the necessary code needed for this project. 

You can check out the workflow build in tines here

export the story in json, and import it into your tenant. It may make more sense how it works. 

Here is a swimlane of the workflow.
